# MERN Stack
MERN Stack is a Javascript Stack that is used for easier and faster deployment of full-stack web applications.

MERN Stack comprises of 4 technologies namely: 
* MongoDB 
* Express
* React
* Node.js.

It is designed to make the development process smoother and easier. Each of these 4 powerful technologies provides an end-to-end framework for the developers to work in and each of these technologies play a big part in the development of web applications.

## Getting to know MERN Stack components

**1. MongoDB: Cross-platform Document-Oriented Database**
---
MongoDB is a NoSQL database where each record is a document comprising of key-value pairs that are similar to JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) objects. MongoDB is flexible and allows its users to create schema, databases, tables, etc. Documents that are identifiable by a primary key make up the basic unit of MongoDB. Once MongoDB is installed, users can make use of Mongo shell as well. Mongo shell provides a JavaScript interface through which the users can interact and carry out operations (eg: querying, updating records, deleting records).

**2. Express: Back-End Framework** 
---
Express is a Node.js framework. Rather than writing the code using Node.js and creating loads of Node modules, Express makes it simpler and easier to write the back-end code. Express helps in designing great web applications and APIs. Express supports many middlewares which makes the code shorter and easier to write.

**3. React: Front-End Library**
---
React is a JavaScript library that is used for building user interfaces. React is used for the development of single-page applications and mobile applications because of its ability to handle rapidly changing data. React allows users to code in JavasScript and create UI components. 

**4.Node.js: JS Runtime Environment**
---
Node.js provides a JavaScript Environment which allows the user to run their code on the server (outside the browser). Node pack manager i.e. npm allows the user to choose from thousands of free packages (node modules) to download.
